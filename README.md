A decentralized content management system implementing Content Addressable Storage (CAS) and Decentralized Immutable Source of Truth (DISOT) with digital signatures.

## üöÄ Features

### Content Addressable Storage (CAS)
- **SHA-256 Hashing**: Every piece of content is addressed by its cryptographic hash
- **Automatic Deduplication**: Identical content is stored only once
- **Content Integrity**: Hash verification ensures content hasn't been tampered with
- **Metadata Support**: Store additional information alongside content
- **Multiple Storage Providers**: In-memory and IndexedDB storage options

### DISOT (Decentralized Immutable Source of Truth)
- **Digital Signatures**: Create cryptographically signed entries
- **Entry Types**: Support for BLOG_POST, DOCUMENT, IMAGE, and SIGNATURE types
- **Signature Verification**: Verify the authenticity of any entry
- **Timestamp Proof**: Each entry includes a timestamp for temporal ordering
- **Blog Post Support**: Create blog posts directly within DISOT entries

### User Interface
- **Modern Angular 18**: Built with standalone components
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile
- **File Upload**: Drag-and-drop or click to upload
- **Content Browser**: Search and preview stored content with multiple view formats
- **Entry Management**: Create and verify DISOT entries
- **Content Preview**: View content as Text, JSON, Hex, Base64, or Image
- **Modal Selection**: Elegant content selection with preview capability
- **Previous Entries**: View and preview historical DISOT entries

### New in v1.1.0
- **IndexedDB Storage**: Persistent browser-based storage implementation
- **Enhanced Content Preview**: Auto-detect content types and manual format selection
- **Modal Content Selection**: Improved UX with preview in selection dialog
- **Blog Post Creation**: Direct blog post creation in DISOT entries
- **Previous Entry Previews**: View content from historical entries
- **Storage Provider Selection**: Runtime configuration of storage backend

## üõ† Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+ (or v20+ recommended)
- npm v9+
- Git

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/o2alexanderfedin/angular-cas-disot.git
cd angular-cas-disot
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`

## üö¶ Quick Start

### Upload Content
1. Navigate to the "Upload" tab
2. Select or drag a file
3. Click "Upload" to store it in CAS
4. Copy the generated hash for future retrieval

### Create DISOT Entry
1. Go to "Create Entry" tab
2. Select previously uploaded content
3. Choose entry type (CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE)
4. The system generates a key pair automatically
5. Click "Create Entry" to sign and store

### Verify Entry
1. Navigate to "Verify" tab
2. Enter an entry ID
3. Click "Load & Verify"
4. View verification results and entry details

## üèó Architecture

The application follows Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

```
src/app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/                 # Business logic and interfaces
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ domain/          # Domain models and interfaces
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ services/        # Application services
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ features/            # Feature modules
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ content/         # Content management components
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ disot/           # DISOT components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/              # Shared modules and utilities
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app.ts              # Root component
```

### Key Design Patterns
- **Dependency Injection**: Services provided at root level
- **Factory Pattern**: Storage provider selection at runtime
- **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation between UI, business logic, and infrastructure
- **Content Addressing**: SHA-256 based deduplication

For detailed architecture documentation, see [docs/architecture](docs/architecture/overview.md).

## üíª Development

### Development Server
```bash
npm start
```
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload on changes.

### Build
```bash
npm run build
```
Build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Code Generation
Generate new components:
```bash
ng generate component features/my-feature --standalone
```

Generate new services:
```bash
ng generate service core/services/my-service
```

## üß™ Testing

### Run Unit Tests
```bash
npm test
```
Executes unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) in headless Chrome.

### Test Coverage
The project maintains high test coverage with 108 tests across all components and services:
- Services: 47 tests
- Components: 61 tests
- All tests passing ‚úÖ

### Test Structure
```typescript
describe('CasService', () => {
  // Setup
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Test configuration
  });
  
  // Test cases
  it('should store content and return hash', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

## üìö Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available in the [`docs/`](docs/) directory:

- [Architecture Overview](docs/architecture/overview.md)
- [API Reference](docs/api/README.md)
- [Component Reference](docs/components/README.md)

## üîÄ GitFlow Workflow

This project uses GitFlow for version management:

### Branch Structure
- `master` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/*` - Feature branches
- `release/*` - Release preparation branches
- `hotfix/*` - Emergency fixes

### Common Commands

Start a new feature:
```bash
git flow feature start my-feature
```

Finish a feature:
```bash
git flow feature finish my-feature
```

Start a release:
```bash
git flow release start 1.1.0
```

Create a hotfix:
```bash
git flow hotfix start 1.0.1
```
