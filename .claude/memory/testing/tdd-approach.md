# TDD Approach for CAS Application

## Test-Driven Development Process

### 1. Red Phase
- Write failing test first
- Test should describe expected behavior
- Run test to ensure it fails

### 2. Green Phase
- Write minimal code to make test pass
- Focus on functionality, not optimization
- Run test to ensure it passes

### 3. Refactor Phase
- Improve code quality
- Apply SOLID principles
- Ensure tests still pass

## Testing Structure

### Unit Tests
- Test individual services and components
- Mock dependencies
- Focus on single responsibility

### Integration Tests
- Test service interactions
- Test component integration
- Verify data flow

### E2E Tests
- Test complete user workflows
- Verify application behavior
- Test real browser interaction

## Test File Naming Convention
- Unit tests: `*.spec.ts`
- Integration tests: `*.integration.spec.ts`
- E2E tests: `e2e/src/*.e2e-spec.ts`

## Coverage Goals
- Minimum 80% code coverage
- 100% coverage for core business logic
- Focus on meaningful tests over coverage numbers
