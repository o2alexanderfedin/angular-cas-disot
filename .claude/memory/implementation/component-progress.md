## Design Patterns Applied

### 1. Component Communication
- Using `@Input()` and `@Output()` decorators
- Event-driven architecture with EventEmitter
- Loose coupling between components

### 2. Service Integration
- Dependency injection of CasService
- Mock services in tests for isolation
- Interface-based programming

### 3. Testing Strategy
- TDD approach - tests written first
- Comprehensive coverage including edge cases
- Async operation testing
- Error handling verification

## Next Components

### DISOT Entry Component (In Progress)
- Create and sign DISOT entries
- Select content from CAS
- Display entry metadata

### Signature Verification Component (Pending)
- Verify DISOT entry signatures
- Display verification status
- Show signer information
