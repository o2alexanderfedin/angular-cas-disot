# CAS Angular App Development Progress

## Completed Tasks

### âœ… Project Setup
- Created new Angular project with SCSS and routing
- Set up memory directory structure under `.claude/memory/`
- Configured testing infrastructure for TDD approach
- Modified karma configuration for headless testing

### âœ… Core Domain Design (SOLID Principles)
- Created domain interfaces following Interface Segregation Principle:
  - `content.interface.ts` - Content and metadata types
  - `storage.interface.ts` - Storage abstraction interfaces
  - `crypto.interface.ts` - Cryptography service interfaces
  - `disot.interface.ts` - DISOT entry and filter types

### âœ… Service Implementations
1. **HashService** - SHA-256 hashing using Web Crypto API
2. **LocalStorageService** - In-memory storage provider
3. **CasService** - Content Addressable Storage implementation
4. **SignatureService** - Mock secp256k1 signatures (for development)
5. **DisotService** - Decentralized Immutable Source of Truth

### âœ… Test Coverage
- All services have comprehensive unit tests
- 30 tests passing with 100% success rate
- TDD approach followed throughout development

## In Progress

### ðŸ”„ Angular Components for UI
- Need to create components for:
  - Content upload
  - Content browsing
  - DISOT entry creation
  - Signature verification

## Pending Tasks

### ðŸ“‹ Routing and Navigation
- Set up app routing
- Create navigation structure
- Implement route guards if needed

### ðŸ“‹ Styling and Responsive Design
- Apply material design or custom theme
- Ensure mobile responsiveness
- Create consistent UI/UX

## Technical Decisions

1. **Mock Cryptography**: Using Web Crypto API with mock implementation for testing. Production will need proper secp256k1 library.

2. **In-Memory Storage**: Currently using Map-based storage. Production should use IndexedDB or server-side storage.

3. **Clean Architecture**: Separated domain interfaces from implementations, following Dependency Inversion Principle.

4. **TDD Approach**: All services developed test-first, ensuring high quality and maintainability.
