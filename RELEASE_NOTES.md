# Release Notes - v1.0.0

## Overview
We are excited to announce the first stable release of the CAS/DISOT Angular application! This release provides a fully functional decentralized content management system with content-addressable storage and digital signature capabilities.

## Key Features

### Content Addressable Storage (CAS)
- Store any content using SHA-256 hashes as addresses
- Automatic content deduplication
- Retrieve content by hash
- List and search all stored content

### DISOT (Decentralized Immutable Source of Truth)
- Create digitally signed entries
- Link entries to content via hashes
- Verify entry signatures
- Support for CREATE, UPDATE, and DELETE operations

### User Interface
- Clean, responsive design
- File upload with drag-and-drop support
- Content list with search and preview
- DISOT entry creation wizard
- Signature verification tool

## Technical Highlights
- Built with Angular 18 and standalone components
- 74 comprehensive tests with 100% passing rate
- Clean Architecture with SOLID principles
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach
- Extensive technical documentation

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/o2alexanderfedin/angular-cas-disot.git
   cd angular-cas-disot
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Run tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## Known Limitations
- Signature service uses mock implementation (production requires real secp256k1)
- Storage is in-memory only (clears on refresh)
- No user authentication system

## Future Roadmap
- Implement real secp256k1 cryptography
- Add persistent storage (IndexedDB/backend)
- User authentication and authorization
- IPFS integration for distributed storage
- Blockchain anchoring for entries

## Documentation
Comprehensive documentation is available in the `/docs` directory, including:
- Architecture diagrams
- API reference
- Component documentation
