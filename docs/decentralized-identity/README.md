# Decentralized Identity Documentation

## Overview

This section contains comprehensive documentation for implementing a minimalistic, blockchain-free decentralized identity system that integrates with the CAS/DISOT platform.

## Documentation Structure

### üìÅ [Architecture](./architecture/)
Technical design and specifications for the decentralized identity system
- [System Architecture](./architecture/system-design.md) - Core architecture and components
- [Technical Review](./architecture/technical-review.md) - Detailed technical assessment
- [Security Model](./architecture/security-model.md) - Security considerations and threat analysis

### üìÅ [Implementation](./implementation/)
Implementation guides and code examples
- [Getting Started](./implementation/getting-started.md) - Quick start guide
- [Core Components](./implementation/core-components.md) - Implementing identity components
- [Browser Compatibility](./implementation/browser-compatibility.md) - Handling browser limitations

### üìÅ [Integration](./integration/)
Integration with CAS/DISOT system
- [CAS Integration](./integration/cas-integration.md) - Storing identity data in CAS
- [DISOT Integration](./integration/disot-integration.md) - Using DIDs with DISOT entries
- [Migration Guide](./integration/migration-guide.md) - Migrating from mock signatures

## Key Concepts

### Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)
Self-sovereign identifiers that users control without central authorities
- Format: `did:key:z6MkhaXgBZDvotDkL5257faiztiGiC2QtKLGpbnnEGta2doK`
- Based on W3C DID specification
- Uses cryptographic keys as identifiers

### Verifiable Credentials
Cryptographically secure, machine-verifiable credentials
- JSON-LD format with semantic meaning
- W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model 2.0
- Self-contained proofs

### Web of Trust
Decentralized trust establishment without blockchain
- Peer-to-peer trust assertions
- Context-specific trust scoring
- No global consensus required
