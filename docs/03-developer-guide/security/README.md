# Security Documentation üîí

This section contains comprehensive security documentation for the CAS/DISOT Angular application.

## Security Topics

### [IndexedDB Security & Isolation](./indexeddb-security.md)
Detailed analysis of IndexedDB security model, same-origin policy enforcement, isolation mechanisms, and cross-origin communication patterns.

### [Security Best Practices](./best-practices.md) *(Coming Soon)*
General security guidelines for Angular applications, including input validation, XSS prevention, and secure coding practices.

### [Authentication Guide](./authentication.md) *(Coming Soon)*
Authentication patterns, JWT handling, session management, and secure storage of credentials.

### [Cryptography Implementation](./cryptography.md) *(Coming Soon)*
Web Crypto API usage, key management, encryption/decryption patterns, and digital signatures.

## Security Principles

1. **Defense in Depth** - Multiple layers of security controls
2. **Least Privilege** - Minimal access rights for all components
3. **Zero Trust** - Verify everything, trust nothing
4. **Secure by Default** - Security enabled out of the box
5. **Fail Secure** - System fails to a secure state

## Common Security Considerations

### Client-Side Storage
- All IndexedDB data is unencrypted by default
- Implement client-side encryption for sensitive data
- Use appropriate storage mechanisms based on security needs
- Regular cleanup of expired data

### Cross-Origin Security
- Strict same-origin policy enforcement
- Secure cross-origin communication via PostMessage
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- CORS configuration for API access

### Input Validation
- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize data before storage
- Prevent XSS attacks
- Use Angular's built-in sanitization

### Cryptographic Operations
- Use Web Crypto API for all cryptographic needs
- Never implement custom crypto
- Secure key generation and storage
- Proper random number generation

## Security Checklist

- [ ] Enable HTTPS in production
- [ ] Implement Content Security Policy
- [ ] Validate and sanitize all inputs
- [ ] Encrypt sensitive data before storage
- [ ] Use secure communication channels
- [ ] Implement proper authentication
- [ ] Regular security audits
- [ ] Monitor for security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Keep dependencies updated
- [ ] Follow OWASP guidelines
