# Coverage Analysis

[‚¨ÖÔ∏è Testing Guide](./testing-guide.md) | [üè† Home](../../README.md)

## Current Coverage Status

### Overall Metrics
- **Statements**: 86.48% (224/259) ‚úÖ
- **Branches**: 75.67% (28/37) ‚úÖ
- **Functions**: 86.88% (53/61) ‚úÖ
- **Lines**: 87.6% (212/242) ‚úÖ

All metrics exceed our minimum goals!

## Coverage Breakdown

### What's Well Tested

1. **Core Services** (90%+ coverage)
   - Hash Service: All cryptographic functions
   - CAS Service: Storage and retrieval operations
   - DISOT Service: Entry creation and verification
   - Storage Service: In-memory operations

2. **Component Logic** (85%+ coverage)
   - Content Upload: File handling and error cases
   - Content List: Search and display logic
   - DISOT Entry: Form validation and submission
   - Signature Verification: Verification flows

### Areas Needing More Coverage

Based on the metrics, approximately 30 lines of code lack coverage. These likely include:

1. **Error Handling Paths**
   ```typescript
   // Example: Rarely triggered error conditions
   catch (error) {
     console.error('Unexpected error:', error);
     this.errorMessage = 'An unexpected error occurred';
   }
   ```

2. **Edge Cases**
   ```typescript
   // Example: Boundary conditions
   if (data.length > MAX_SIZE) {
     throw new Error('Data too large');
   }
   ```

3. **Component Lifecycle**
   ```typescript
   // Example: Cleanup logic
   ngOnDestroy() {
     this.subscription?.unsubscribe();
   }
   ```

## Improving Coverage

### Quick Wins (Add 5-10% coverage)

1. **Add Error Path Tests**
   ```typescript
   it('should handle storage errors gracefully', async () => {
     mockStorageService.write.and.returnValue(Promise.reject(new Error('Storage full')));
     
     await expectAsync(service.store(content)).toBeRejectedWith(
       jasmine.objectContaining({ message: 'Storage full' })
     );
   });
   ```

2. **Test Edge Cases**
   ```typescript
   it('should handle empty content', async () => {
     const emptyContent = { data: new Uint8Array(0) };
     const hash = await service.store(emptyContent);
     expect(hash).toBeDefined();
   });
   ```

3. **Component Destruction**
   ```typescript
   it('should clean up on destroy', () => {
     const spy = spyOn(component.subscription, 'unsubscribe');
     component.ngOnDestroy();
     expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalled();
   });
   ```

## Coverage by File Type

### Services (High Coverage ~90%)
- Strong unit test coverage
- Mock dependencies properly used
- Both success and error paths tested

### Components (Good Coverage ~85%)
- User interactions tested
- Form validations covered
- Could add more edge cases

### Interfaces (Not Counted)
- Pure TypeScript interfaces
- No executable code
- Not included in coverage metrics

## Best Practices for Maintaining Coverage

1. **Write Tests First (TDD)**
   - Ensures all new code is tested
   - Prevents coverage regression

2. **Test the Behavior, Not Implementation**
   ```typescript
   // Good: Test what the user experiences
   it('should display error when upload fails', () => {});
   
   // Bad: Test internal implementation
   it('should call _handleError method', () => {});
   ```

3. **Use Coverage Reports During Development**
   ```bash
   # Run in watch mode with coverage
   ng test --watch --code-coverage
   ```

4. **Focus on Meaningful Coverage**
   - Don't just chase 100%
   - Test important business logic thoroughly
   - Simple getters/setters may not need tests

## Excluded from Coverage

The following are intentionally excluded:
- `main.ts` - Bootstrap code
- `*.spec.ts` - Test files themselves
- Interface definitions
- Type declarations
- Barrel exports (index.ts files)

## Next Steps

To reach 90%+ coverage:

1. **Identify Uncovered Lines**
   ```bash
   open coverage/cas-app/index.html
   ```

2. **Prioritize by Risk**
   - Error handling (high priority)
   - Business logic (high priority)
   - UI helpers (medium priority)
   - Logging (low priority)

3. **Add Targeted Tests**
   - Focus on uncovered branches
   - Test error scenarios
   - Add edge case tests
